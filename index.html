            Hey team, if you haven't already notice, I'm a :sparkles: people pleaser :sparkles:. I will therefore be helpful as a facilitator for the group. I can also be a "help butterfly" (yep, I just made that up), flying from table to table for quick help.
            I also fancy a good organized file so if you need someone to take notes or do a synthesis, I'm your pal ! 
        </p>
    <h5>A funny story</h5>
        <p>
            When I was a kid, I was a real social butterfly. When my family and I were going on vacation, I would dispear of our campsite to have "apero" with other campers (and yes, my parents were always worrying).
        </p>
    <h6>TL;DR I was a child way to sociable.</h6>
